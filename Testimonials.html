                <p style="color: black;">Robina is a type of woman who valus her relationship with God more than anything. <br>A woman of love especially when we talk about her family.<br> A strong woman who can surpass all the problems that the world throws. <br>Indeed, she is a beatiful woman, inside and out.</p>

                <p style="color: black;">When I met Robina I didn’t imagine that I would be close to her because it seemed <br>like she was hard to get along with but look  at now she became <br> close to me and at the same time she was my classmate  <br> and specially she’s my church mate I still don’t know who <br> she is but based on what we see in her she is a good person kind and most of all there is her eagerness to praise Lord</p>
