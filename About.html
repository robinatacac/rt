            <p style ="text-align:center; font-size: 15px;">There are many people in the world who have different personalities. <br>It is this personality that makes everyone unique and different from others.<br> Talking about myself, I am Robina Tacac Studying at Isabela State University Ilagan Campus,<br>I live in Cabicera 6-24 I’m 20 years old My Fathers name is Robert Tacac and My mother’s is Myrna Tacac,<br> I am a rare piece of myself. You can’t find a person like me. I am a self-br
            <br>centered fellow, love admiring the beauty of life and achieving my dreams.
I’ll start by saying that I’m a highly interesting and challenging person to understand. <br>Having a kind heart for everyone I encounter. Ambitious people will do anything to reach their goals.<br>Despite my fierce competitive drive, I try to see the positive side of everything. <br>Many hinges in my opinion, can make us unhappy or angry,<br> but it does not mean we should stop trying to live. <br>In actually, difficulties are a sign of existence. Therefore, it’s a good thing that we havebr
 issues. It strengthens the mind.<br> This is how I see the world.As a person , I like to keep a smile on my face no matter what I’m going through, and that smile keeps me going .<br>Beside, I was brought up in Multicultural  community ,Therefore, I am an extrovert, and I like to meet people. Moreover, I am  reliable but very short-tempered .<br> I lose my Calm if not  understood properly.<br>I get irritated internally, but that doesn’t show in my behavior. However, I would like to change this character trait a little because my friends and dear ones often do not notice that I have some troubles.<br> Thus, they do  not offer help when I need it.
Good or bad this is me, trying to contemplate the world as it is revealing its true colors. <br>I believed that the life is a gift, and it should be treated life one, with love care and respect</p>
